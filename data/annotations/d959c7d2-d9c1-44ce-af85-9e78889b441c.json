Though it is not like this for the deer, it is not shame because the deer is not human. It is only almost human when it looks on the road and leaps covering at least 30 feet in a blink. The deer I cannot be. The dumb deer, dumb and foolish enough to ignore anything that runs but is not alive.

Or how could I refuse peace the taste of unlovable hand clapping? Yell. My mouth is a stone box. It does trap fault. The trouble of tobacco leaves opening over ten days only for a water balloon clown to smear lifeless lips crosswise on my wrinkled eyelids three decades up so. At least, my girl, you've carried worlds in your voice, all of them from atrium to ventricle without weeping for me. Your starlet homologue dreamed in the later afternoon of this hospital chart, pressed to my weak artery. Working the air black from my devotion to clay is this.

Only seconds later I'm being treated to a blow by blow chronicle of the shaving of his head and the sloppy gouge with the distracted barber's razor cut deep. And mama, there was blood everywhere, but it look all right now, wait till you see I'm bald-headed. In the next breath, I'm scared mama, I'm sick, I cough all night."

We are march rent party slow drag and shy town stomp step and twisted in Rita's tango, watch us barracuda and black bottom in delectable tandem. We march I love the lord he heard my cry, we march Saturday morning chitin assembly line, our rations are scrubbed to stank and doused with unnameable heat.

I cannot claim success until I am a soldier within the scanned prayer of your soldier bodies until we share sinew and gush, until we snort weep because too much anguish will not stop its happening and there's never enough time to rhyme it. I cannot claim success until we learn together what a bitch happiness can be. How bladed its edges are, how sometimes is it unleashing to bleed and notice that the first mentioning of blood is also a mentioning of joy. I cannot claim success until we the final victims of an insane grace, the silliest most muscled and musical cousins upon cousins until each soldier has wearied and fallen for a final time until we are laid to rest beneath the landscape we have worn dim with our marching. Above us the rooting of blooms will be unquestioned, everything will be a window letting in light, they will wallow in Camila Aisha moonlight. The flowers that grow will begin their own outlines, they will slip fluid in hue, watercoloring their own little lives. When our joined souls claw up to the soil surface, when our vultures and brash dactyls sparkle the dirt, the flowers will flood neon, they will try on new teeth, they will realize their own regiment, they mourn each releasing a soldier's name to the wind and there will be forever a need for armies."
